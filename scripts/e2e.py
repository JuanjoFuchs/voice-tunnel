"""End-to-end acceptance for spec 001 (AC-E1..E4).

Drives a **real browser** whose microphone is a WAV file, so the path under test is the genuine
one: browser mic capture -> WebSocket -> resample -> VAD segmentation -> Whisper -> wake gate ->
JSONL turn log -> `watch` cursor -> TTS -> WebSocket -> Web Audio playback in the page.

Nothing on that path is mocked. That matters, because every component here is individually
plausible and the failures live in the seams — sample-rate mismatches, an utterance that never
ends because the fake mic loops without a gap, audio that decodes but never plays.

Exit: 0 = every assertion held; non-zero = the first failure, printed.
